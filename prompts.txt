AI Interaction Prompts:

1. Initial Setup and Understanding:
- "Help me understand the CDAP Wrangler project structure and where to implement byte size and time duration parsers"
- "What are the key components we need to modify to add new token types?"

2. Grammar Implementation:
- "How should we define BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION tokens in the ANTLR grammar?"
- "What are the valid byte size and time duration units we should support?"

3. Token Classes:
- "Help me implement ByteSizeToken and TimeDurationToken classes"
- "How should we handle unit conversions and validation?"

4. AggregateStats Directive:
- "How should we implement the aggregate-stats directive?"
- "What's the best way to handle aggregation of byte sizes and time durations?"

5. Testing:
- "Help me write comprehensive tests for the new token types"
- "How should we test the aggregate-stats directive?"

6. Build and Integration:
- "Help me resolve Maven build issues"
- "How do we verify the implementation is working correctly?"

Key Decisions Made:
1. Supported byte size units: B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB
2. Supported time duration units: ns, ms, s, m, h, d
3. Used canonical units: bytes for size, nanoseconds for time
4. Implemented comprehensive error handling and validation
5. Added extensive test coverage for all components
